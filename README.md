# AFRICAN-FOOD-PRODUCTION
This is a dataset for African food Production where I performed data cleaning, exploration, wrangling and a little bit of visualization. The dataset contains millions of data divided into 60943 rows and 12 columns. Dataframes were created and a lot of indexing and slicing were done.
